## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### Step 1: Apply for Google AdSense

1. **Visit**: https://www.google.com/adsense
2. **Click**: "Get Started"
3. **Sign in** with your Google account (fightershooter3@gmail.com)
4. **Fill in details**:
   - Website URL: Your website domain

### Step 2: Website Requirements (✅ Your site is ready!)

Your website already meets these requirements:

### Step 3: Add AdSense Code to Your Website

Once approved, Google will give you:

2. **Ad Units**: Different ad formats and sizes

**I've already prepared your website for AdSense!** You just need to:

1. Get your Publisher ID from AdSense dashboard
2. Replace `ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` in these files:
   - `app/layout.tsx` (line 52)
   - `components/AdSense.tsx` (line 26)

### Step 4: Create Ad Units

After approval, create ad units in your AdSense dashboard:

**Recommended Ad Placements:**
1. **Header Banner** (728x90 or responsive)
2. **Sidebar Ads** (300x250 or 300x600)
3. **In-Content Ads** (Between sections)
4. **Footer Ads** (728x90 or responsive)

## 🎯 Best Ad Placement Strategy

### High-Performing Locations:
1. **Above the fold** (visible without scrolling) - 30% higher CTR
2. **Within content** (between paragraphs) - Natural engagement
3. **End of articles** - Catches readers finishing content
4. **Sidebar** (if you add one) - Persistent visibility

### Avoid:
- ❌ Too many ads (max 3-4 per page)
