# QUICK DEPLOY INSTRUCTIONS

Since we can't create a GitHub repo directly, here are your options:

## Option 1: Create GitHub Repo (2 minutes - BEST!)
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: vlovsol-portfolio
3. Make it PUBLIC
4. Click "Create repository"
5. Copy the URL (like: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vlovsol-portfolio)
6. Tell me, I'll upload your code in 30 seconds!

## Option 2: Use Template (Fast but needs customization)
Paste this in Vercel:
https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-typescript

Then after deploy, I'll help you replace files.

## Option 3: Deploy Without GitHub (EASIEST!)
Just click "Continue with GitHub" button instead!
Then I'll guide you through importing!

RECOMMENDED: Option 1 - Takes 2 minutes, then your site is PERFECT!
